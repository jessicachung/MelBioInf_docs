<h1 id="rna-seq-differential-gene-expression-basic-tutorial">RNA-Seq Differential Gene Expression: Basic Tutorial</h1>
<p><strong>Authors: Mahtab Mirmomeni, Andrew Lonie, Jessica Chung</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="tutorial-overview">Tutorial Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we cover the concepts of RNA-seq differential gene expression
(DGE) analysis using a small synthetic dataset from the model organism,
Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>The tutorial is designed to introduce the tools, datatypes and workflow of an
RNA-seq DGE analysis. In practice, real datasets would be much larger and
would contain sequencing and alignment errors that make analysis more difficult.</p>
<p>Our input data for this tutorial will be raw RNA-seq reads from two
experimental conditions and we will output a list of differentially
expressed genes identified to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will:  </p>
<ul>
<li>introduce the types of files typically used in RNA-seq analysis</li>
<li>align RNA-seq reads with Tophat</li>
<li>visualise RNA-seq alignment data with IGV</li>
<li>find differentially expressed genes with Cuffdiff</li>
<li>understand the importance of replicates for differential expression analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial does not cover the following steps that you would do in a real
RNA-seq DGE analysis:  </p>
<ul>
<li>QC (quality control) of the raw sequence data</li>
<li>Trimming the reads for quality and for adaptor sequences</li>
<li>QC of the RNA-seq alignment data  </li>
</ul>
<p>These steps have been omitted because the data we use in this tutorial is
synthetic and has no quality issues, unlike real data.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h4 id="where-does-the-data-in-this-tutorial-come-from">Where does the data in this tutorial come from?</h4>
<p>The data for this tutorial is from an RNA-seq experiment looking for
differentially expressed genes in D. melanogaster (fruit fly) between two
experimental conditions. The experiment and analysis protocol we will follow
is derived from a paper in Nature Protocols by the research group responsible
for one of the most widely used set of RNA-seq analysis tools: <em>"Differential
gene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and
Cufflinks"</em> (Trapnell et al 2012).</p>
<p>The sequence datasets are single-end Illumina synthetic short reads,
filtered to only include chromosome 4 to facilitate faster mapping (which
would otherwise take hours). We’ll use data from three biological replicates
from each of the two experimental conditions.</p>
<h4 id="the-tuxedo-protocol">The Tuxedo Protocol</h4>
<p>The workflow this tutorial is based on is the Tuxedo Protocol. Reads are first
mapped with TopHat and a transcriptome is then assembled using Cufflinks.
Cuffdiff then quantifies the expression in each condition, and tests for
differential expression.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we use a simpler protocol as the D. melanogaster
transcriptome is already very well characterised.</p>
<p>More information about the Tuxedo protocol can be found <a href="../rna_seq_basic_background">here</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>You should now have the following files in your Galaxy history:</p>
<p>6 files containing single-ended reads:
<ul>
<li>C1_R1.chr4.fq
<li>C1_R2.chr4.fq
<li>C1_R3.chr4.fq
<li>C2_R1.chr4.fq
<li>C2_R2.chr4.fq
<li>C2_R3.chr4.fq<br />
</ul></p>
<p>And 1 gene annotation file:
<ul>
<li>ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf<br />
</ul></p>
<p>These files can be renamed by clicking the <strong>pen icon</strong> if you wish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These 6 sequencing files are in FASTQ format and have the file
    extension: .fq. If you are not familiar with the FASTQ format, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format">click
    here for an overview</a>.  </p>
<p>Click on the <strong>eye icon</strong> to the top right of each FASTQ file to view the
first part of the file.
The first 3 files are from the first condition (C1) and has 3
replicates labelled R1, R2, and R3. The next 3 FASTQ files are from
the second condition (C2) and has 3 replicates labelled R1, R2, and R3.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to find genes which are differentially
expressed between condition C1 and condition C2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gene annotation file is in GTF format. This file describes where
    the genes are located in the Drosophila reference genome.
    We will examine this file more closely later in Section 3 of this
    tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since the reads in this dataset are synthetic, they do not have
real quality scores.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you log out of Galaxy and log back at a later time your data
and results from previous experiments will be available in the right panel
of your screen called the ‘History’</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-2-align-reads-with-tophat-30-mins">Section 2: Align reads with Tophat [30 mins]</h2>
<p>In this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As
these reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron
boundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware
mapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results
from Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on
Tophat can be found <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="2-examine-the-output-files">2.  Examine the output files</h4>
<p>You should have 5 output files for each of the FASTQ input files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: accepted_hits:</strong> This is a BAM file containing
  sequence alignment data of the reads. This file contains the location
  of where the reads mapped to in the reference genome. We will examine
  this file more closely in the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: splice junctions:</strong> This file lists all the places
  where Tophat had to split a read into two pieces to span an exon
  junction.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: deletions</strong> and <strong>Tophat on data 1: insertions:</strong>
  These files list small insertions or deletions found in the reads.
  Since we are working with synthetic reads we can ignore Tophat for
  Illumina data 1:insertions Tophat for Illumina data 1:deletions for now.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: align_summary:</strong> This file gives some mapping
  statistics including the number of reads mapped and the mapping rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should have a total of 30 Tophat output files in your history.</p>
<h4 id="3-visualise-the-aligned-reads-with-igv">3.  Visualise the aligned reads with IGV</h4>
<p>The purpose of this step is to :</p>
<ul>
<li>visualise the quantitative, exon-based nature of RNA-seq data</li>
<li>visualise the expression differences between samples represented by the
  quantity of reads, and</li>
<li>become familiar with the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">Integrative Genomics Viewer
  (IGV)</a>-- an interactive
  visualisation tool by the Broad Institute.  </li>
</ul>
<p>To visualise the alignment data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on one of the Tophat accepted hits files, for example 'Tophat on
    data 1: accepted_hits'.</li>
<li>Click on Display with IGV <strong>'webcurrent'</strong> (or 'local' if you have IGV
    installed on your computer. You will need to open IGV before you click on
    'local'). This should download a .jnlp Java Web Start file to your
    computer. Open this file to run IGV. (You will need Java installed on your
    computer to run IGV)</li>
<li>Once IGV opens, it will show you the accepted_hits BAM file. (Note:
    this may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded to IGV)</li>
<li>Select <strong>chr4</strong> from the second drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to
    view alignments of reads to the reference genome.
    You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across
    the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.
    The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the
    abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.
    (Note that IGV already has a list of known genes of most major organisms
    including Drosophila, which is why you can see the genes in the bottom
    panel of IGV.)</li>
<li>View one of the splice function files such as 'TopHat on data 1: splice
    junctions'. You will need to save this file to your local disk
    using the <strong>disk icon</strong> under the details of the file. Then open
    the saved .bed file directly in IGV using the <strong>File &gt; Load From File</strong>
    option from IGV. This is because IGV doesn’t automatically stream BED
    files from Galaxy.
    <br><img src="../media/rna_basic_igv.png" height=400px style="border: 1px solid gray; margin: 10px;"/><br>
    The junctions file is loaded at the bottom of the
    IGV window and splicing events are represented as coloured arcs. The
    height and thickness of the arcs are proportional to the read depth.</li>
<li>
<p>View differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files
    simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test
    differential expression, but first it’s useful to reassure ourselves
    that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads
    for condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2).</p>
<p>Select 'TopHat on data 4: accepted_hits' (this is the accepted hits
alignment file from first replicate of condition C2) and click on
'display with IGV local'. This time we are using the <strong>'local'</strong> link, as
we already have an IGV window up and running locally from the last
step. One the file has loaded, change the location to
<strong>chr4:325197-341887</strong> using the field on the top toolbar.</p>
<p>The middle gene in this area clearly looks like it has many more reads
mapped in condition 2 than condition 1, whereas for the surrounding
genes the reads look about the same. The middle gene looks like it is
differentially expressed. But, of course, it may be that there are
many more reads in the readsets for C1 and C2, and the other genes
are underexpressed in condition 2. So we need to statistically
normalise the read counts before we can say anything definitive,
which we will do in the next section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="4-optional-visualise-the-aligned-reads-in-trackster">4.  <strong>[Optional]</strong> Visualise the aligned reads in Trackster</h4>
<p>We can also use the inbuilt Galaxy genome browser, Trackster, to visualise
alignments. Trackster has fewer features than IGV, but sometimes it may be
more convenient to use as it only requires the browser.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar of Galaxy, select <strong>Visualization &gt; New Track Browser</strong>.</li>
<li>Name your new visualization and select D. melanogaster (dm3) as the
    reference genome build.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Datasets to Visualization</strong> button and select Tophat on
    data 1: accepted_hits and Tophat on data 4: accepted_hits by using the
    checkboxes on the left.</li>
<li>Select chr4 from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the
    buttons on the top toolbar. You can also add more tracks using the Add
    Tracks icon located on the top right.</li>
<li>Next to the drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number
    display and specify the location <strong>chr4:325197-341887</strong>.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Before starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return
to the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top
Galaxy toolbar.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-3-test-differential-expression-with-cuffdiff-45-min">Section 3: Test differential expression with Cuffdiff [45 min]</h2>
<p>The aim in this section is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate tables of normalised read counts per gene per condition based on the
  annotated reference transcriptome,</li>
<li>statistically test for expression differences in normalised read counts for
  each gene, taking into account the variance observed between samples,  </li>
<li>for each gene, calculate the p-value of the gene being differentially
  expressed-- this is the probability of seeing the data or something more
  extreme given the null hypothesis (that the gene is not differentially
  expressed between the two conditions),</li>
<li>for each gene, estimate the fold change in expression between the two
  conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these steps are rolled up into a single tool in Galaxy: Cuffdiff. Cuffdiff
is part of the Cufflinks software suite which takes the aligned reads from
Tophat and generates normalised read counts and a list of differentially
expressed genes based on a reference transcriptome - in this case, the curated
Ensembl list of D. melanogaster genes from chromosome 4 that we supply as a
GTF (Gene Transfer Format) file.
A more detailed explanation of Cufflinks DGE testing can be found
<a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="1-examine-the-reference-transcriptome">1.  Examine the reference transcriptome</h4>
<p>Click on the <strong>eye icon</strong> to display the ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf reference
transcriptome file in Galaxy.</p>
<p>The reference transcriptome is essentially a list of chromosomal features
which together define genes. Each feature is in turn defined by a
chromosomal start and end point, feature type (CDS, gene, exon etc),
and parent gene and transcript. Importantly, a gene may have many features,
but one feature will belong to only one gene.
More information on the GTF format can be found
<a href="http://asia.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html">here</a>.
<br><img src="../media/rna_basic_gtf.png" height=200px style="margin: 10px;"/><br>
The ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf file contains ~4900 features which together define
the 92 known genes on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster. Cuffdiff
uses the reference transcriptome to aggregate read counts per gene,
transcript, transcription start site and coding sequence (CDS). For this
tutorial, we’ll only consider differential gene testing, but it is also
possible to test for differential expression of transcripts or
transcription start sites.</p>

<div class="question">
    <h4>How many genes are in the Significant_DE_Genes file? What are their names?</h4>
    <p>
    Two genes have been identified as differentially expressed between

    You should get <em>no</em> differentially expressed genes at statistical

</li>
</ol>
<div class="question">
    <h4>How can we interpret the difference in results from using different
    replicates? </h4>
    <p>
    There is a larger absolute difference in CG1277 expression between
    samples 1 (C1_R1) and 5 (C2_R2) than samples 1 (C1_R1) and 4 (C2_R1), hence
    Cuffdiff identifies CG1277 as differentially expressed between C1_R1 and
    C2_R2, but not between C1_R1 and C2_R1.
    <p>
    On the other hand, differences in level of expression of Ank is much smaller
    between samples, so we need to see it consistently across multiple replicates
    for Cuffdiff to be confident it actually exists. One replicate is not enough.
</div>

<p>The identification of differentially expressed genes is based on the size
of the difference in expression and the variance observed across multiple
replicates. This demonstrates how important it is to have biological replicates
in differential gene expression experiments.</p>
<p>If we say that genes Ank and CG2177 are <strong>truly</strong> differentially expressed, we
can call these instances where the true differentially expressed genes are not
identified as false negatives. Generally, increasing replicates decreases the
number of false negatives.</p>
<p>It is also more likely to see more false positives when using an insufficient
number of replicates. False positives can be defined as identifiying a gene as
differentially expressed when it is, in reality, not.</p>
<p><strong>[Optional step]</strong><br />
Repeat this analysis, specifying groups of two replicates each. What do you
get? How many replicates do we need to identify Ank as differentially
expressed?</p>

<h4 id="extension-on-the-tuxedo-protocol">Extension on the Tuxedo Protocol</h4>
<p>The full Tuxedo protocol includes other tools such as Cufflinks, Cuffmerge,
and CummeRbund. Cufflinks and Cuffmerge can build a new reference transcriptome by
identifying novel transcripts and genes in the RNA-seq dataset - i.e. using these tools will allow
you to identify new genes and transcripts, and then analyse them for
differential expression. This is critical for organisms in which the
transcriptome is not well characterised. CummeRbund helps visualise the data
produced from the Cuffdiff using the R statistical programming language.</p>
<p>Read more on the full Tuxedo protocol <a href="../rna_seq_basic_background">here</a>.</p>

identified as differentially expressed by Cuffdiff using the GTF file produced
from Cufflinks and Cuffmerge. The locations of these two genes correspond to
the previous result from section 3 (genes Ank and CG2177).</p>
<h4 id="transcript-level-differential-expression">Transcript-level differential expression</h4>
<p>One can think of a scenario in an experiment aiming to investigate the
differences between two experimental conditions, where a gene had the same
number of read counts in the two conditions but these read counts were derived
from different transcripts; this gene would not be identified in a differential
gene expression test, but would be in a differential transcript expression test.
The choice of what "unit of aggregation" to use in differential expression
testing is one that should be made by the biological investigator, and will
affect the bioinformatics analysis done (and probably the data generation too).</p>
<p>Take a look at the different differential expression files produced by
Cuffdiff from section 3 which use different units of aggregation.</p>
